Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international, ethical, scientific and quality standard for the
conduct of trials that involve human participants. Clinical trials conducted in accordance with
this standard will help to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are
protected; that the conduct is consistent with the principles that have their origin in the
Declaration of Helsinki; and that the clinical trial results are reliable. The term “trial conduct”
in this document includes processes from planning to reporting, including planning, initiating,
performing, recording, oversight, evaluation, analysis and reporting activities as appropriate.

9
10
11

The objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard to facilitate the mutual
acceptance of clinical trial data for ICH member countries and regions by applicable regulatory
authorities.

12
13
14
15

This guideline builds on key concepts outlined in ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for
Clinical Studies. This includes fostering a quality culture and proactively designing quality into
clinical trials and drug development planning, identifying factors critical to trial quality, and
engaging stakeholders, as appropriate, using a proportionate risk-based approach.

16
17
18

Clinical trials vary widely in scale, complexity and cost. Careful evaluation of the priorities
involved in each trial and the risks associated with the priorities will help ensure efficiency by
focusing on activities critical to achieving the trial objectives.

19

Guideline Scope

20
21
22
23

This guideline applies to interventional clinical trials of investigational products 1 that are
intended to be submitted to regulatory authorities. This guideline may also be applicable to
other interventional clinical trials of investigational products that are not intended to support
marketing authorisation applications in accordance with local requirements.

24

Guideline Structure

25
26
27
28
29

This ICH GCP Guideline is composed of principles and annexes that expand on the principles,
with specific details for different types of clinical trials. The principles are intended to apply
across clinical trial types and settings and to remain relevant as technological and
methodological advances occur. The principles outlined in this guideline may be satisfied using
differing approaches and should be applied to fit the intended purpose of the clinical trial.

30
31
32
33
34

Annex-1 is intended to provide information on how the principles can be appropriately applied
to clinical trials. Additional annexes may be developed to respond to stakeholder needs and to
address emerging innovations in trial design and conduct. This guideline should be read in
conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the design and conduct of clinical trials,
including multiregional trials.

For the purpose of this guideline, the term “investigational products” should be considered synonymous with
drugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products.

II. PRINCIPLES OF ICH GCP

36
37
38
39
40
41

Clinical trials are a fundamental part of clinical research that support the development of new
medicines or uses of existing medicines. Well-designed and conducted clinical trials help
answer key questions in healthcare and drug development. Their results are essential for
evidence-based healthcare decisions. Trials with inadequate design and/or poorly conducted
trials may place participant safety at risk and yield inadequate or unreliable evidence and are
unethical. They waste resources and the efforts and time of investigators and participants.

42
43
44
45
46
47
48
49

The principles of GCP are designed to be flexible and applicable to a broad range of clinical
trials. This guideline, along with ICH E8(R1), encourages thoughtful consideration and
planning to address specific and potentially unique aspects of an individual clinical trial. This
includes evaluation of trial characteristics, such as the design elements, the investigational
product being evaluated, the medical condition being addressed, the characteristics of the
participants, the setting in which the clinical trial is being conducted, and the type of data being
collected. Careful consideration of factors relevant to ensuring trial quality is needed for each
clinical trial.

50
51
52
53
54
55
56
57
58

The principles are intended to support efficient approaches to trial design and conduct. For
example, innovative digital health technologies, such as wearables and sensors, may expand
the possible approaches to trial conduct. Such technologies can be incorporated into existing
healthcare infrastructures and enable the use of a variety of relevant data sources in clinical
trials. This will aid in keeping clinical trial conduct in line with advancing science and
technological developments. The use of technology in the conduct of clinical trials should be
adapted to fit the participant characteristics and the particular trial design. This guideline is
intended to be media neutral to enable the use of different technologies for the purposes of
documentation.

59
60
61
62
63
64
65

The use of innovative clinical trial designs and technologies may help include diverse patient
populations, as appropriate, and enable wider participation. The design of the trial, to ensure
appropriate quality and meaningful trial outcomes, may be supported by the perspectives of
stakeholders; for example, patients and/or healthcare providers. Their input can increase the
likelihood of meaningful trial outcomes, which are relevant to both trial participants and future
patients. This input will also guide decisions on the feasibility of data collection and assure that
participation in the trial does not become unduly burdensome for those involved.

66
67
68
69
70
71
72
73

Clinical trials should be designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of participants and
assure the reliability of results. Quality by design should be implemented to identify the factors
(i.e., data and processes) that are critical to ensuring trial quality and the risks that threaten the
integrity of those factors and ultimately the reliability of the trial results. Clinical trial processes
and risk mitigation strategies implemented to support the conduct of the trial should be
proportionate to the importance of the data being collected and the risks to trial participant
safety and data reliability. Trial designs should be operationally feasible and avoid unnecessary
complexities.

74
75
76
77

The overarching principles provide a flexible framework for clinical trial conduct. They are
structured to provide guidance throughout the life cycle of the clinical trial. These principles
are applicable to trials involving human participants. The principles are interdependent and
should be considered in their totality to assure ethical trial conduct and reliable results.

1.

Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCP
and applicable regulatory requirement(s). Clinical trials should be designed and
conducted in ways that ensure the rights, safety and well-being of participants.
1.1
1.2

1.3

1.4

1.5

1.6

2.

The rights, safety and well-being of the participants are the most important
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.
The safety of the participants should be reviewed periodically as new safety
information becomes available, which could have an impact on the participant
or the conduct of the trial.
Foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the anticipated
benefits for the individual participants and society. A trial should be initiated
and continued only if the anticipated benefits justify the known and anticipated
risks.
When designing a clinical trial, the scientific goal and purpose should be
carefully considered so as not to unnecessarily exclude particular participant
populations. The participant selection process should be representative of the
anticipated population who is likely to use the medicinal product in future
clinical practice to allow for generalising the results across the broader
population. Certain trials (e.g., early phase, proof of concept trials,
bioequivalence studies) may not require a heterogeneous population.
A qualified physician or, when appropriate, a qualified dentist (or other
qualified healthcare professionals in accordance with local regulatory
requirements) should have the overall responsibility for the trial-related medical
care given to, and medical decisions made on behalf of, participants; however,
the practical interactions and the delivery of medical care and decisions can be
carried out by appropriately qualified healthcare professionals in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements.
The confidentiality of information that could identify participants should be
protected in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection
requirements.

Informed consent is an integral feature of the ethical conduct of a trial. Clinical
trial participation should be voluntary and based on a consent process that
ensures participants (or their legally acceptable representatives, where
applicable) are well-informed.
2.1

2.2

Freely given informed consent should be obtained and documented from every
participant prior to clinical trial participation. For potential participants unable
to provide informed consent, their legally acceptable representative should
provide consent prior to clinical trial participation.
The process and information provided should be designed to achieve the
primary objective of enabling potential trial participants to evaluate the benefits
and risks of participating in the trial and to make an informed decision on
whether or not to participate in the trial. The information provided during the

Clinical trials should be subject to an independent review by an institutional
review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC).
3.1
3.2

4.

4.2

4.3

The available nonclinical and clinical information on an investigational
product(s) should be adequate to support the proposed clinical trial.
Clinical trials should be scientifically sound and reflect the state of knowledge
and experience with the investigational product(s), including, if applicable, the
condition to be treated, diagnosed or prevented; the current understanding of
the underlying biological mechanism (of both the condition and the treatment);
and the population for which the investigational product is intended.
There should be periodic review of current scientific knowledge and approaches
to determine whether modifications to the trial are needed, since new or
unanticipated information may arise once the trial has begun.

Clinical trials should be designed and conducted by qualified individuals.
5.1

6.

A trial should always be conducted in compliance with the protocol that
receives prior IRB/IEC approval/favourable opinion.
Periodic review of the trial by the IRB/IEC should also be conducted in
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Clinical trials should be scientifically sound for their intended purpose and based
on robust and current scientific knowledge and approaches.
4.1

5.

informed consent process should be clear and concise so as to be understandable
by potential participants or legally acceptable representatives.
The informed consent process should take into consideration relevant aspects
of the trial, such as the characteristics of the participants, the trial design, the
anticipated benefit and risk of medical intervention(s), the setting and context
in which the trial will be conducted (e.g., trials in emergency situations), and
the potential use of technology to inform participants (or their legally
acceptable representatives) and obtain informed consent.

Individuals with different expertise and training may be needed across all
phases of a clinical trial, such as physicians, scientists, ethicists, technology
experts, trial coordinators, monitors, auditors and statisticians. Individuals
involved in a trial should be qualified by education, training and experience to
perform their respective task(s).

Quality should be built into the scientific and operational design and conduct of
clinical trials.
6.1

Quality of a clinical trial is considered in this guideline as fit for purpose. The
quality and amount of the information generated during a clinical trial should
support good decision making.

Clinical trial processes, measures and approaches should be implemented in a
way that is proportionate to the risks to participants and to the importance of
the data collected.
7.1

7.2

7.3

8.

Trial processes should be proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the
importance of the information collected. Risks in this context include risks to
the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants as well as risks to the
reliability of the trial results.
The focus should be on the risks to participants beyond those associated with
standard medical care. The risks relating to investigational products that have a
marketing authorisation when used in the clinical trial context may differ from
the routine care of patients and should be taken into consideration.
Risks to critical to quality factors should be managed prospectively and
adjusted when new or unanticipated issues arise once the trial has begun.

Clinical trials should be described in a clear, concise and operationally feasible
protocol.
8.1
8.2
8.3

9.

Factors critical to the quality of the trial should be identified. These factors are
attributes of a trial that are fundamental to the protection of participants, the
reliability and interpretability of the trial results and the decisions made based
on those trial results. Quality by design involves focusing on the design of all
components of the trial in order to maximise the likelihood of trial success (i.e.,
that the trial will answer the research question).
Strategies should be implemented to avoid, detect and address serious noncompliance with GCP, the trial protocol and applicable regulatory requirements
to prevent recurrence.

A well-designed trial protocol is fundamental to the protection of participants
and for the generation of reliable results.
The scientific objectives of any trial should be clear and explicitly stated in the
protocol.
The clinical trial protocol as well as the plans or documents for the protocol
execution (e.g., statistical analysis plan, data management plan, monitoring
plan) should be clear, concise and operationally feasible.

Clinical trials should generate reliable results.
9.1

9.2

The quality and amount of the information generated in a clinical trial should
be sufficient to provide confidence in the trial’s results and support good
decision making.
Systems and processes that aid in data capture, management and analyses, as
well as those that help ensure the quality of the information generated from the
trial, should be fit for purpose, should capture the data required by the protocol
and should be implemented in a way that is proportionate to the risks to
participants and the importance of acquired data.

factors critical to their quality should be addressed in their design or adaptation
for clinical trial purposes.
Clinical trials should incorporate efficient and well-controlled processes for
managing records through appropriate management of data integrity,
traceability and protection of personal information, thereby allowing the
accurate reporting, interpretation and verification of the clinical trial-related
information.
Clinical trial-related records should be retained securely by sponsors and
investigators for the required period of time and should be available to
regulatory authorities upon request to enable reconstruction of the trial conduct
and results in order to ensure the reliability of trial results.
The transparency of clinical trials in drug development includes registration on
publicly accessible and recognised databases and the public posting of clinical
trial results.

Roles and responsibilities in clinical trials should be clear and documented
appropriately.
10.1 The sponsor may transfer or the investigator may delegate some or all their
tasks, duties or functions (hereafter referred to as activities), but they retain
overall responsibility for their respective activities.
10.2 Agreements should clearly define the roles, activities and responsibilities for
the clinical trial and be documented appropriately. Where activities have been
transferred or delegated to service providers, the responsibility for the conduct
of the trial, including quality and integrity of the trial data, resides with the
sponsor or investigator, respectively.
10.3 The sponsor or investigator should maintain appropriate oversight or
supervision of the aforementioned activities, respectively.

11.

Investigational products used in a clinical trial should be manufactured in
accordance with applicable Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and
be stored, shipped, handled and disposed of in accordance with the product
specifications and the trial protocol.
11.1 Investigational products used in a clinical trial should be manufactured in
accordance with applicable GMP standards.
11.2 Measures should be in place to ensure that the investigational product provided
to trial participants retains its quality.
11.3 Investigational products should be used in accordance with the protocol and
relevant trial documents.

any other documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfil its responsibilities.

The IRB/IEC should review a proposed clinical trial within a reasonable time and
document its reviews clearly identifying the trial, the documents reviewed and the
dates for the following:
(a)

approval/favourable opinion;

(b)

modifications required prior to its approval/favourable opinion;

(c)

disapproval/negative opinion;

(d)

termination/suspension of any prior approval/favourable opinion.

1.1.4

The IRB/IEC should conduct continuing review of each ongoing trial at intervals
appropriate to the degree of risk to participants.

1.1.5

The IRB/IEC may request more information than is outlined in section 2.8.11 be given
to participants when, in the judgement of the IRB/IEC, the additional information
would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the
participants.

1.1.6

Where the protocol indicates that prior consent of the trial participant or the
participant’s legally acceptable representative is not possible (see section 2.8.9), the
IRB/IEC should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s)
adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meet applicable regulatory
requirements for such trials (e.g., in emergency situations).

1.1.7

If minors are to be included in a trial, the IRB/IEC should review the assent
information considering the age, maturity and psychological state of the minor, as
well as applicable regulatory requirements.

1.1.8

If the trial participants are compensated for their participation in the trial, the IRB/IEC
should review both the amount and method of payment to participants to assure that
neither presents problems of coercion or undue influence on the trial participants.
Payments to a participant should be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion
of the trial by the participant. Reasonable reimbursement of participants for travel and
lodging is not typically coercive.

1.1.9

The IRB/IEC should ensure that information regarding payment to participants,
including the methods, amounts and schedule of payment to trial participants, is set
forth in the informed consent material and any other information to be provided to
participants.

Adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities required for safety evaluations
(as outlined in the protocol) should be reported to the sponsor according to the
reporting requirements and within the time periods specified in the protocol.

(b)

All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported immediately (after the
investigator reasonably becomes aware of the event) to the sponsor. In
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the protocol may identify
SAEs not requiring immediate reporting, for example, deaths or other events
that are endpoints. Subsequent information should be submitted as a followup report, as necessary.

(c)

For reported deaths, the investigator should supply the sponsor, the IRB/IEC
and, where applicable, the regulatory authority with any additional requested
information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports) when they
become available.

In obtaining and documenting informed consent (paper or electronic format), the
investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should
adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of
Helsinki. See the glossary term “informed consent.” The informed consent process
should include the following:
(a)

Prior to consenting and enrolling participants, the investigator should have the
IRB/IEC’s documented approval/favourable opinion of the informed consent
materials and process;

(b)

The information should be as clear and concise as possible, use simple
language and avoid unnecessary volume and complexity. This is to ensure that
the trial participants or their legally acceptable representatives have an
adequate understanding of the objectives of the trial, alternative treatments,
the potential benefits and risks, burdens and their rights and obligations to be
able to make an informed decision as to their participation in the trial;

2.8.2

Varied approaches (e.g., text, images, videos and other interactive methods)
may be used in the informed consent process including for providing
information to the participant. Obtaining consent remotely may be considered
where appropriate.

The participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be
informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be
relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue trial participation. The
communication of this information and confirmation of the willingness to continue
trial participation should be documented.
New information that could impact a participant’s willingness to continue
participation should be assessed to determine if re-consent is needed (e.g., depending
on the stage of the trial, consideration should be given to whether the new information
is relevant only to new participants or to existing participants). If re-consent is needed
(e.g., information on emerging safety concerns), new information should be clearly
identified in the revised informed consent materials. Revised informed consent
materials should receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favourable opinion in advance of
use.

2.8.3

Neither the investigator nor the investigator site staff should coerce or unduly
influence a participant to participate or to continue their participation in the trial.

2.8.4

None of the information provided to the participant during the informed consent
process should contain any language that causes the participant or the participant’s
legally acceptable representative to waive or to appear to waive any legal rights, or
that releases or appears to release the investigator, the institution, the sponsor or their
service providers from liability for negligence.

2.8.5

The informed consent process should be conducted by the investigator or other
investigator site staff delegated by the investigator, in accordance with applicable
regulatory requirements. If the participant is unable to provide consent themselves,
the participant’s legally acceptable representative should provide their consent on
behalf of the participant.

2.8.6

The information provided during the informed consent process and translations should
be relevant, clear, simple, concise and understandable to the participant or the
participant’s legally acceptable representative and the impartial witness, where
applicable.

2.8.7

Before informed consent may be obtained, the investigator or investigator site staff
delegated by the investigator, in accordance with the protocol and conditions of
IRB/IEC favourable opinions/approvals, should provide the participant or the
participant’s legally acceptable representative ample time unless justified (e.g., in an
emergency situation) and opportunity to enquire about trial details and to decide
whether or not to participate in the trial. Questions about the trial should be answered

to the satisfaction of the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable
representative.
2.8.8

Prior to trial participation, the informed consent form should be signed and dated by
the participant or by the participant’s legally acceptable representative and, where
appropriate, impartial witness and by the investigator or delegated investigator site
staff who conducted the informed consent discussion. The informed consent process
may involve a physical signature or an electronic signature.

2.8.9

In emergency situations, when prior consent of the participant is not possible, the
consent of the participant’s legally acceptable representative, if present, should be
requested. When prior consent of the participant is not possible and the participant’s
legally acceptable representative is not available, enrolment of the participant should
require measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented
approval/favourable opinion by the IRB/IEC, to protect the participant’s rights, safety
and well-being and to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be
informed about the trial as soon as possible, and consent as appropriate (see section
2.8.10) should be requested.

2.8.10

If a participant or the legally acceptable representative is unable to read, an impartial
witness should be present (remotely or in-person) during the entire informed consent
discussion. After the informed consent form and any other information is read and
explained to the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative and
they have orally consented to the participant’s trial participation and, if capable of
doing so, have signed and personally dated the informed consent form, the witness
should contemporaneously sign and personally date the consent form. By signing the
consent form, the witness attests that the consent information was accurately
explained to and apparently understood by the participant or the participant’s legally
acceptable representative and that informed consent was freely given by the
participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative.

2.8.11

The informed consent discussion and the informed consent materials to be provided
to participants should explain the following as applicable:
(a)

the purpose of the trial;

(b)

that the trial involves research and summary of the experimental aspects of the
trial;

(c)

the trial’s investigational product(s) and the probability for random
assignment to the investigational product, if applicable;

(d)

the trial procedures to be followed including all invasive procedures;

(e)

the participant’s obligations;

representative should receive a copy (paper or electronic) of the signed informed
consent form and any other informed consent materials provided to the participants,
or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. During trial participation,
the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should receive a
copy of the consent form updates and any other updated informed consent materials
provided to participants.

2.8.13

Where a minor is to be included as a participant, age-appropriate assent information
should be provided and discussed with the minor as part of the consent process, and
assent from the minor to enrol in the trial should be obtained as appropriate. A process
for re-consent should be considered if, during the course of the trial, the minor reaches
the age of legal consent, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

2.8.14

When a clinical trial includes participants who may only be enrolled in the trial with
the consent of the participant’s legally acceptable representative (e.g., minors, patients
with severe impaired decision-making capacity), the participant should be informed
about the trial to the extent compatible with the participant’s understanding and, if
capable, the participant should sign and personally date the informed consent form or
assent form as appropriate.

2.8.15

In exceptional circumstances (e.g., public health emergencies), when the usual
methods to obtain and document informed consent are not possible, the use of
alternative measures and technologies in accordance with local IRBs/IECs and

2.9.1

When a participant decides to stop treatment with the investigational product, stop
trial visits or completely withdraw from a trial; is discontinued from the trial; or
reaches routine end of trial, the investigator should follow the protocol and other
sponsor instructions to determine appropriate follow-up measures. This may include
instructions to avoid unnecessary loss of already collected critical data in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements.

2.9.2

Although a participant is not obliged to provide a reason(s) for withdrawing
prematurely from a trial, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain

the reason(s), while fully respecting the participant’s rights. The investigator should
consider discussing with the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable
representative the reasons for withdrawal to determine if there are ways to address the
concerns. The investigator site staff should make an effort to explain to the participant
the value and importance of continuing their participation to minimise trial
participants withdrawal.
2.9.3

Where relevant, the investigator should inform the participant about the trial results
and treatment received when this information is available from the sponsor after
unblinding, with due respect to the participant’s preference to be informed.

2.10.1

Responsibility for investigational product(s) accountability rests with the
investigator/institution. The sponsor may facilitate this process.

2.10.2

When the investigator/institution assigns some or all of their activities for
investigational product(s) accountability to a pharmacist or another individual, they
should be under the supervision of the investigator/institution.

2.10.3

The investigator/institution and/or a pharmacist or other appropriate individual should
maintain records of the product’s delivery, the inventory, the use by each participant
(including documenting that the participants were provided the doses specified by the
protocol) and the return to the sponsor and destruction or alternative disposition of
unused product(s). These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial
numbers, expiration dates (if applicable) and the unique code numbers assigned to the
investigational product(s) and trial participants. For authorised medicinal products,
alternative approaches to the aforementioned may be considered, in accordance with
local regulatory requirements.

2.10.4

The investigational product(s) should be stored as specified by the sponsor and in
accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s).

2.10.5

The investigator should ensure that the investigational product(s) are used only in
accordance with the approved protocol.

2.10.6

Where applicable, the investigator or a person designated by the
investigator/institution should explain the correct use of the investigational product(s)
to each participant and should check, at intervals appropriate for the trial, that each
participant is following the instructions properly.

The investigator should follow the trial’s randomisation procedures, if any, and, in the case of
an investigator-blinded trial, should ensure that the identification code is broken only in
accordance with the protocol. In the case of an emergency, to protect patient safety, the
investigator should be prepared and capable from the start of the trial to perform unblinding
without undue delay and hinderance. The investigator should promptly document and explain
19

ICH E6(R3) Guideline
829

2.12.1

In generating, recording and reporting trial data, the investigator should ensure the
integrity of data under their responsibility, irrespective of the media used.

2.12.2

The investigator/institution should maintain adequate source records that include
pertinent observations on each of the trial participants under their responsibility.
Source records should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate
and complete. Changes to source records should be traceable, should not obscure the
original entry and should be explained if necessary (via an audit trail). The
investigator should define what is considered to be a source record(s), the methods of
data capture and their location prior to starting the trial and should update this
definition when needed. Unnecessary transcription steps in between the source record
and the data acquisition tool should be avoided.

2.12.3

The investigator should have timely access to and be responsible for the timely review
of data, including relevant data from external sources (e.g., central laboratory data,
centrally read imaging data, other institution’s records and, if appropriate, electronic
patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data) which can have an impact on, for example,
participant eligibility, treatment or safety. The protocol may provide exceptions for
access, for instance, to protect blinding.

2.12.4

The investigator should ensure that data acquisition tools and other systems deployed
by the sponsor for clinical trial purposes are used as specified in the protocol or trialrelated instructions.

2.12.5

The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness
of the data reported to the sponsor in the data acquisition tools completed by the
investigator site (e.g., case report form (CRF)) and in all required reports. The
investigator should review and endorse the reported data at milestones agreed upon
with the sponsor (e.g., interim analysis).

2.12.6

Data reported to the sponsor should be consistent with the source records or the
discrepancies explained. Changes or corrections in the reported data should be
traceable, should be explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.

2.12.7

The investigator/institution should implement appropriate measures to protect the
privacy and confidentiality of personal information of trial participants in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements on personal data protection. Data reported to
the sponsor should be identified by an unambiguous participant code that can be traced
back to the identity of the participant by the investigator/institution.

2.12.8

For systems deployed by the investigator/institution that maintain and retain trial
data/information, the investigator/institution should ensure that such data are

2.12.9

When using computerised systems in a clinical trial, the investigator/institution should
do the following:
(a)

for systems deployed by the investigator/institution, ensure that appropriate
individuals have secure and attributable access;

(b)

for systems deployed by the investigator/institution specifically for the
purposes of clinical trials, ensure that the requirements for computerised
systems in section 4 are addressed;

(c)

where equipment for data acquisition is provided to trial participants by the
investigator, ensure that traceability is maintained and participants are
provided with appropriate training;

(d)

ensure that incidents in the use and operation of computerised systems, which
in their judgement may have a significant and/or persistent impact on the trial
data, are reported to the sponsor and, where applicable, to the IRB/IEC.

2.12.10 The investigator/institution should maintain the trial records as specified in Appendix
C. Essential Records for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as required by the
applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution should have control
of all essential records generated by the investigator/institution before, during and
after the trial. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental
or premature destruction of these records. If the investigator closes a site or leaves a
site during or after the end of the clinical trial, the sponsor should be notified of the
appropriate individual responsible for retention of the site’s essential records.
2.12.11 The investigator/institution should retain the essential records for the required
retention period in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or until the
sponsor informs the investigator/institution that these records are no longer needed,
whichever is the longer (see Appendix C).
2.12.12 Upon request of the monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC or regulatory authority, the
investigator/institution should make available for direct access all requested trialrelated records.

3.9.1

The sponsor should ensure that the trial design and trial conduct, the processes
undertaken, and the information and data generated are of sufficient quality to ensure
reliable trial results, trial participant’s safety and appropriate decision making.

3.9.2

The sponsor should ensure that trial processes are conducted in compliance with the
trial protocol and related documents as well as with applicable regulatory
requirements and ethical standards.

3.9.3

The sponsor should determine necessary trial-specific criteria for classifying protocol
deviations as important (i.e., those that impact the rights, safety and well-being of trial
participants and the reliability of results).

3.9.4

Decisions related to the trial should be appropriately assessed for their impact on
participant’s rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of trial results. Risks
related to such decisions should be suitably managed throughout the planning,
conduct and reporting of the trial.

3.9.5

The range and extent of oversight measures should be fit for purpose and tailored to
the complexity of and risks associated with the trial. The selection and oversight of
investigators and service providers are fundamental features of the oversight process.
Oversight by the sponsor includes quality assurance and quality control processes
relating to the trial-related activities of investigators and service providers.

3.9.6

The sponsor should ensure appropriate and timely escalation and follow-up of issues
to allow the implementation of appropriate actions in a timely manner.

3.9.7

The sponsor may consider establishing an IDMC to assess the progress of a clinical
trial including the safety data and the efficacy endpoints at intervals and to recommend
to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or stop a trial.

3.9.8

Where appropriate, sponsors may also establish an endpoint assessment/adjudication
committee in certain trials to review important endpoints reported by investigators to
determine whether the endpoints meet protocol-specified criteria. Such committees
should typically be blinded to the assigned treatments when performing their
assessments, regardless of whether the trial itself is conducted in a blinded manner, to
ensure that the data reviewed by committee are as free of bias as possible.

3.9.9

Committees established for purposes that could impact participant safety or the
reliability of trial results should include members with relevant expertise and with
managed conflicts of interest, have written operating procedures (e.g., charters) and
document their decisions.

1105
1106
1107
1108
1109
1110
1111
1112

The sponsor should implement an appropriate system to manage quality throughout all stages
of the trial process. Quality management includes the design and implementation of efficient
clinical trial protocols including tools and procedures for trial conduct (including for data
collection and management) in order to support participant’s rights, safety and well-being and
the reliability of trial results. The sponsor should adopt a proportionate and risk-based approach
to quality management, which involves incorporating quality into the design of the clinical trial
(i.e., quality by design) and identifying those factors that are likely to have a meaningful impact
on participant’s rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of the results (i.e., critical to
quality factors as described in ICH E8(R1)). The sponsor should describe the quality
management approach implemented in the trial in the clinical trial report (see ICH E3).

1113

3.10.1

1114

A proportionate approach to the identification and management of risk is described below:

1115

3.10.1.1 Risk Identification

1116
1117
1118
1119
1120

Risk Management

The sponsor should identify risks that may have a meaningful impact on critical to
quality factors. Risks should be considered across the processes used in the clinical
trial (e.g., patient selection, informed consent process, randomisation and
investigational product administration, data handling, and service provider activities).
3.10.1.2 Risk Evaluation

1121

The sponsor should evaluate potential risks by considering:

1122
1123
1124
1125
1126
1127

(a)

the likelihood of harm/hazard occurring;

(b)

the extent to which such harm/hazard would be detectable;

(c)

the impact of such harm/hazard on trial participant protection and the
reliability of trial results.

1128

3.10.1.3 Risk Control

1129
1130

(a)

Risk control should be proportionate to the importance of the risk to
participants’ rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of trial results.

Risk mitigation activities may be incorporated in protocol design and
implementation, monitoring plans, agreements between parties defining roles
and responsibilities, systematic safeguards to ensure adherence to SOPs, and
training in processes and procedures.
(b)

3.10.1.4 Risk Communication

1141
1142
1143
1144
1145

The sponsor should communicate the identified risks and mitigating activities, if
applicable, to those who are involved in taking action or are affected by such activities.
Communication also facilitates risk review and continual improvement during clinical
trial conduct.
3.10.1.5 Risk Review

1146
1147
1148
1149

The sponsor should periodically review risk control measures to ascertain whether the
implemented quality management activities remain effective and relevant, taking into
account emerging knowledge and experience.
3.10.1.6 Risk Reporting

1150
1151
1152
1153

The sponsor should summarise and report the risks and the remedial actions taken in
relation to important deviations from the acceptable ranges as detailed in section
3.10.1.3(b) and document them in the clinical trial report (ICH E3).
3.11

1154

Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The sponsor is responsible for establishing, implementing and maintaining
appropriate quality assurance and quality control processes and documented
procedures to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated, recorded and
reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory
requirement(s).

3.11.1

1160
1161
1162
1163
1164

The sponsor should set acceptable ranges to support this process within which
variation can be accepted. Where deviation beyond these ranges is detected,
an evaluation should be performed to determine if there is a possible systemic
issue and if action is needed.

Quality Assurance
Quality assurance should be applied throughout the clinical trial and includes
implementing strategies to identify potential or actual causes of serious noncompliance with the protocol, GCP and/or applicable regulatory requirements to
enable their corrective and/or preventive actions.

3.11.2

Audit

1165
1166

When performed, audits should be conducted in a manner that is proportionate to the
risks associated with the conduct of the trial.

1167
1168
1169

The purpose of a sponsor’s audit, which is independent of and separate from routine
monitoring or quality control functions, is to evaluate whether the processes put in
place to manage and conduct the trial are effective and compliant.

(a)

The sponsor should ensure that the auditing of clinical trials/processes is
conducted in accordance with the sponsor’s documented procedures on what
to audit, how to audit (i.e., on-site or remote), the frequency of audits and the
form and content of audit reports.

(b)

The sponsor’s audit plan, program and procedures for a trial audit should be
guided by the importance of the trial to submissions to regulatory authorities,
the number of participants in the trial, the type and complexity of the trial, the
level of risks to the trial participants and any identified problem(s).

(c)

The observations and findings of the auditor(s) should be documented.

(d)

To preserve the independence and value of the audit function, the regulatory
authority(ies) should not routinely request the audit reports. Regulatory
authority(ies) may seek access to an audit report on a case-by-case basis when
evidence of serious GCP non-compliance exists or in the course of legal
proceedings.

(e)

When required by applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor should
provide an audit certificate.

Quality Control
Quality control should be applied to each stage of the data handling to ensure that data
are reliable and have been processed correctly. Within clinical trials, monitoring and
data management processes are the main quality control activities.
The quality control of sites (other than investigator sites, such as centralised imaging
reading facilities), including on site and/or centralised activities, may be undertaken
and reported using a risk-based approach.

3.11.4

Monitoring

1206
1207
1208

The aim of monitoring is to ensure the participants’ rights, safety and well-being and
the reliability of trial results as the trial progresses. Monitoring is one of the principal
quality control activities.

1209
1210
1211

Monitoring involves a broad range of activities including, but not limited to,
communication with investigator sites, verification of the investigator and investigator
site staff qualifications and site resources, training and review of trial documents and

information using a range of approaches including source data review, source data
verification, data analytics and visits to institutional facilities undertaking trial-related
activities. Some of these monitoring activities may be conducted by different methods
and persons with different roles. However, monitoring should be performed by
persons not involved in the clinical conduct of the trial being monitored. The
monitoring approach should consider the activities and services involved, including
decentralised settings, and be included in the monitoring plan. Monitors and other trial
staff should adhere to data protection and confidentiality requirements in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements, institution policy and established data
security standards.

1222
1223
1224

Monitoring activities may include site monitoring (performed on-site or remotely) and
centralised monitoring, depending on the monitoring strategy and the design of the
clinical trial.

1225
1226
1227
1228

The sponsor should determine the appropriate extent and nature of monitoring, based
on identified risks. Factors such as the objective, purpose, design, complexity,
blinding, number of trial participants, investigational product, current knowledge of
the safety profile and endpoints of the trial should be considered.

3.11.4.1 Investigator Site Monitoring
(a)

Monitoring may be performed in relation to the clinical trial activities at the
investigator sites (e.g., including their pharmacies and local laboratories, as
appropriate). The frequency of monitoring activities should also be determined
based on identified risks. Monitoring activities and their frequency should be
modified as appropriate using knowledge gained.

(b)

This monitoring activity may be performed on-site or remotely depending on
the nature of the activity and its objectives.

(c)

Monitoring may include secure, remote, direct read-only access to source
records, other data acquisition tools and essential record retention systems.

3.11.4.2 Centralised Monitoring
(a)

Centralised monitoring is an evaluation of accumulated data, performed in a
timely manner, by the sponsor’s qualified and trained persons (e.g., medical
monitor, data scientist/data manager, biostatistician).

(b)

Centralised monitoring processes provide additional monitoring capabilities
that can complement and reduce the extent and/or frequency of site monitoring
or be used on its own. Use of centralised data analytics can help identify
systemic or site-specific issues, including protocol non-compliance and
potentially unreliable data.

(c)

Centralised monitoring may support the selection of sites and/or processes for
targeted site monitoring.

1256
1257
1258
1259
1260
1261
1262
1263

The sponsor should develop a monitoring plan that is tailored to the identified
potential safety risks, the risks to data quality and/or other risks to the reliability of
the trial results. Particular attention should be given to procedures relevant to
participant safety and to trial endpoints. The plan should describe the monitoring
strategy, the monitoring activities of all the parties involved, the various monitoring
methods and tools to be used, and the rationale for their use. The monitoring strategy
should ensure appropriate oversight of trial conduct and consider site capabilities and
the potential burden. The plan should focus on aspects that are critical to quality. The
monitoring plan should reference the sponsor’s applicable policies and procedures.

1264
1265
1266
1267

Monitoring of key data and processes (e.g., those related to primary endpoints and key
secondary endpoints and processes intended to assure patient safety) performed
outside the investigator site (e.g., central reading facilities, central laboratories) should
be addressed in the monitoring plan.

1268
1269

sponsor and the investigator and other parties and individuals involved
in the trial conduct (e.g., centrally performed activities). In general, each
site should have an assigned monitor as their contact point.

(b)

Informing the investigator or other parties and individuals involved in
the trial conduct of identified deviations from the protocol, GCP and the
applicable regulatory requirements and taking appropriate action
designed to prevent recurrence of the detected deviations. Important
deviations should be highlighted and should be the focus of remediation
efforts as appropriate.

(c)

Informing the investigator or other parties and individuals involved in
the trial conduct of source record(s) or entry errors or omissions in data
acquisition tools and ensuring that corrections, additions or deletions are
made as appropriate, dated, explained (if necessary) and that approval
of the change is properly documented.

(d)

Actions taken in relation to the deviations, errors or omissions should be
proportionate to their importance.

Noncompliance with the protocol, SOPs, GCP and/or applicable regulatory
requirement(s) by an investigator/institution or by member(s) of the sponsor’s staff
should lead to appropriate and proportionate action by the sponsor to secure
compliance.

3.12.2

If noncompliance that significantly affects or has the potential to significantly affect
trial participant’s rights, safety or well-being or the reliability of trial results is
discovered, the sponsor should perform a root cause analysis, implement appropriate
corrective and preventive actions and confirm their adequacy unless otherwise
justified. Where the sponsor identifies issues that could significantly impact
participant’s rights, safety and well-being or the reliability of trial results, the sponsor
should notify the regulatory authority and/or IRB/IEC in line with applicable
regulatory requirements.

3.12.3

If the monitoring and/or auditing identifies serious noncompliance on the part of an
investigator/institution that persists despite efforts at remediation, the sponsor should
terminate the investigator’s/institution’s participation in the trial. When an
investigator’s/institution’s participation is terminated because of noncompliance, the
sponsor should promptly notify the regulatory authority(ies) and IRB/IEC as
appropriate.

Safety Reporting
(a)

The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority(ies) safety updates and
periodic reports, including changes to the Investigator’s Brochure, as required
by applicable regulatory requirements.

(b)

The sponsor should, in accordance with the applicable regulatory
requirement(s) and with ICH E2A Clinical Safety Data Management:
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, expedite the reporting to
the regulatory authority(ies) of all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that meet
three criteria: suspected, unexpected and serious (i.e., SUSARs).

(c)

Safety reporting to regulatory authorities should be undertaken by assessing
the expectedness of the reaction in relation to the applicable product
information (e.g., the reference safety information (RSI) contained within the
Investigator’s Brochure or alternative documents) in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements. Refer to ICH E2F Development Safety
Update Report for more information about RSI.

(d)

The reporting of SUSARs to investigator(s)/institutions(s) and to the
IRB(s)/IEC(s) should be undertaken in a manner that reflects the urgency of
action required and should take into consideration the evolving knowledge of
the safety profile of the product. Reporting of SUSARs to the
investigators/institutions should be made in accordance with regulatory
requirements. In some regions, periodic reporting of line listings with an
overall safety assessment may be appropriate.

(e)

Urgent safety issues requiring immediate attention or action should be
reported to the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authority(ies) and investigators
without undue delay and as specified in regulatory requirements.

3.13.3

Alternative arrangements for safety reporting to regulatory authorities,
IRBs/IECs, and investigators and for reporting by investigators to the sponsor
should be prospectively agreed upon with the regulatory authority(ies) and the
IRB/IEC if applicable, and described in the clinical trial protocol, (e.g., SAEs
considered efficacy or safety endpoints, which would not be subject to
unblinding and expedited reporting; see ICH E2A). See ICH E19.

Managing an Immediate Hazard

1477
1478
1479

The sponsor should take prompt action to address immediate hazards to participants.
The sponsor should determine the causes of the hazard and based on this, take
appropriate remedial actions.

1480
1481
1482
1483
1484

The sponsor should consider whether the protocol requires amendment in response to
an immediate hazard. The information on the immediate hazard, if required, and any
subsequent protocol amendment should be submitted to the IRB/IEC and/or
regulatory authorities by the investigator/institution or sponsor (in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements).

(b)

The sponsor should determine acceptable storage temperatures and other
storage conditions (e.g., protection from light) for the investigational
product(s), appropriate reconstitution fluids and procedures, and devices for
product infusion, if any. The sponsor should inform all involved parties (e.g.,
monitors, investigators, pharmacists, storage managers) of these
determinations.

(c)

The investigational product(s) should be packaged to prevent contamination
and unacceptable deterioration during transport and storage.

(d)

In blinded trials, the sponsor should implement:

(e)

3.15.3

(i)

a process to blind the sponsor staff, trial participant and/or investigator
as appropriate to the investigational product identity and assignment to
prevent and detect inappropriate unblinding;

(ii)

a procedure and mechanism that permits the investigator to rapidly
identify the product(s) in case of a medical emergency where
unblinding is considered necessary, while protecting the identity of the
treatment assignment of the other trial participants;

(iii)

a mechanism that protects the blinding of the trial where a participant’s
treatment assignment is unblinded for the purpose of safety reporting
to regulatory authorities and/or IRB/IEC, where appropriate.

If significant formulation changes are made in the investigational product(s)
(including active control(s) and placebo, if applicable) during the course of
clinical development, the results of any additional studies of the formulated
product(s) (e.g., stability, dissolution rate, bioavailability) needed to assess
whether these changes would significantly alter the pharmacokinetic profile
of the product should be available prior to the use of the new formulation in
clinical trials.

Supplying and Handling Investigational Product(s)
(a)

The sponsor is responsible for supplying the investigator(s)/institution(s) with
the investigational product(s) or, where appropriate, supplying trial
participants in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and after
obtaining the required approval/favourable opinion from the IRB/IEC and the
regulatory authority(ies) for the trial.

(b)

The sponsor should ensure that instructions are available for the
investigator/institution or trial participants on the handling and storage of
investigational product(s). The procedures should consider adequate and safe
receipt, handling, storage, dispensing, retrieval of unused product from
participants and return of unused investigational product(s) to the sponsor (or

(c)

The sponsor should:
(i)

ensure timely delivery of investigational product(s) to the
investigator(s) or, where appropriate, to trial participants in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements to avoid any interruption to
the trial as well as for the continuation of treatment for participants.

(ii)

maintain records that document the identity, shipment, receipt, return
and destruction, or alternative disposition of the investigational
product(s) (see Appendix C);

(iii)

maintain a system for retrieving investigational products and
documenting this retrieval (e.g., for deficient product recall, return and
destruction, or alternative disposition after trial completion, or expired
product reclaim);

(iv)

maintain a system for the disposition of unused investigational
product(s) and for the documentation of this disposition;

(v)

take steps to ensure that the investigational product(s) are stable over
the period of use and only used within the current shelf-life;

(vi)

maintain sufficient quantities of the investigational product(s) used in
the trials to reconfirm specifications should this become necessary and
maintain records of batch sample analyses and characteristics. The
samples should be retained either until the analyses of the trial data are
complete or as required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s),
whichever represents the longer retention period. The samples do not
need to be kept by the sponsor in trials where an authorised medicinal
product is used as an investigational product unmodified from its
authorised state, since samples are kept by the manufacturer.

The sponsor should pre-specify data to be collected and the method of its
collection in the protocol (see Appendix B. Clinical Trial Protocol and
Protocol Amendment(s)). Where necessary, additional details, including a
data flow diagram, should be contained in a protocol-related document (e.g.,
a data management plan).

(d)

The sponsor should ensure that data acquisition tools are fit for purpose and
designed to capture the information required by the protocol. They should be
validated and ready for use prior to their required use in the trial.

(e)

The sponsor should ensure that documented processes are implemented to
ensure the data integrity for the full data life cycle.

(f)

The sponsor should implement measures to ensure the safeguarding of the
blinding, if any (e.g., maintain the blinding during data entry and processing).

(g)

The sponsor should provide guidance to investigators/institutions, service
providers and trial participants, where relevant, on the expectations for data
capture, data changes, data retention and data disposal.

(h)

The sponsor should not make changes to data entered by the investigator or
trial participants unless justified and documented by the sponsor and agreed
upon by the investigator.

(i)

The sponsor should allow correction of errors to data, including data entered
by participants, where requested by the investigators/participants. Such data
corrections should be justified and supported by source records around the
time of original entry.

(j)

The sponsor should ensure that the investigator has access to data collected in
accordance with the protocol during the course of the trial including relevant
data from external sources, for example, central laboratory data, centrally read
imaging data and, if appropriate, ePRO data that are necessary to enable the
investigators to make decisions (e.g., on eligibility, treatment, continuing
participation in the trial and care for the safety of the individual trial
participants). The sponsor should pay special attention to data that may
unblind the investigator and include the appropriate provisions in the protocol.

(k)

The sponsor should not have exclusive control of data captured in data
acquisition tools.

(l)

The sponsor should ensure that the investigator has access to the required data
for retention purposes.

(m)

The sponsor should ensure that the investigator receives instructions on how
to navigate systems, data and relevant metadata for the trial participants under
their responsibility.

(n)

The sponsor should seek investigator endorsement of their data at
predetermined milestones.

(o)

The sponsor should document the data management steps to be undertaken
prior to data analysis. These steps may vary depending on the purpose of the
analysis to be conducted (e.g., data for IDMC, for interim analysis or the final
analysis).

(p)

Prior to provision of the data for analysis, edit access to the data acquisition
tools should be restricted as appropriate to the purpose of the analysis; for
example, for interim analysis, the restriction may only be temporary or
managed differently compared to the final analysis.

(q)

Deviations from the planned statistical analysis or changes made to the data
analysis set after the trial has been unblinded (where applicable) should be
clearly documented and justified and should only occur in exceptional
circumstances (e.g., data discrepancies that must be resolved for the reliability
of the trial results). Data changes should be authorised by the investigator and
reflected in an audit trail. Post-unblinding data changes and deviations from
the planned statistical analyses should be reported in the clinical trial report.

(r)

The sponsor should use an unambiguous trial participant identification code
(see glossary term) that allows identification of all the data reported for each
participant.

(s)

The sponsor should implement appropriate measures to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of personal information of trial participants, in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements on personal data protection.

(t)

In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor should
document what happens to data when a participant withdraws or discontinues
from the trial.

(u)

The sponsor should ensure that trial data are protected from unauthorised
access, disclosure, dissemination or alteration and from inappropriate
destruction or accidental loss.

(v)

The sponsor should have processes and procedures in place for reporting
incidents (including security breaches) that have a significant impact on the
trial data to relevant parties, including regulatory authorities, where relevant.

When using computerised systems in a clinical trial, the sponsor should:
(i)

have a record of the computerised systems used in a clinical trial. This
should include the use, functionality, interfaces and validation status
of each computerised system, and who is responsible for its
management should be described. The record should also include a
description of implemented access controls and internal and external
security measures;

(ii)

ensure that the requirements for computerised systems deployed by the
sponsor (e.g., requirements for validation, audit trails, user
management, backup, disaster recovery and IT security) are addressed
and implemented and that documented procedures and adequate
training are in place to ensure the correct development, maintenance
and use of computerised systems in clinical trials (see section 4). These
requirements should be proportionate to the importance of the
computerised system and the data or activities they are expected to
process;

(iii)

maintain a record of the individual users who are authorised to access
the system, their roles and their access privileges:

(iv)

ensure that access rights granted to investigator site staff are in
accordance with delegations by the investigator and visible to the
investigator;

(v)

for systems deployed by the investigator/institution, assess whether
such systems, if identified as containing source records in the trial,
(e.g., electronic health records and other record keeping systems for
source data collection and investigator site files) are fit for purpose or
whether the known issue(s) can be appropriately mitigated. This
assessment should occur during the process of selecting clinical trial
sites and should be documented;

(vi)

ensure that there is a process in place for service providers and
investigators to inform the sponsor of system defects identified or
incidents that could potentially constitute a serious non-compliance
with the clinical trial protocol, trial procedures or GCP in accordance
with section 3.13.

This section provides guidance to investigators and sponsors (i.e., the responsible parties) on
appropriate management of data integrity, traceability and security, thereby allowing the
accurate reporting, verification and interpretation of the clinical trial-related information. This

The quality and amount of the information generated in a clinical trial should be sufficient to
address trial objectives, provide confidence in the trial’s results and support good decision
making.

1822
1823

The systems and processes that help ensure this quality should be designed and implemented
in a way that is proportionate to the risks to participants and the reliability of trial results.

1824
1825

The following key processes should address the full data life cycle with a focus on the criticality
of the data and should be implemented proportionately and documented appropriately:

(b)

processes for managing computerised systems to ensure that they are fit for
purpose and used appropriately;

(c)

processes to safeguard essential elements of the clinical trial, such as
randomisation, dose escalation and blinding;

(d)

processes to support key decision making, such as data finalisation prior to
analysis, unblinding, allocation to analysis data sets, changes in clinical trial
design and, where applicable, the activities of, for example, an IDMC.

Maintaining the integrity of the blinding is important in particular in the design of
systems, management of users’ account, delegation of responsibilities with respect to
data handling and provision of data access at sites, data transfers, database review
prior to planned unblinding and statistical analysis across all appropriate stages of the
trial.

4.1.2

Roles, responsibilities and procedures for access to unblinded information should be
defined and documented by all relevant parties according to the protocol; this
information may also be included in the data management plans and statistical
analysis plans. For example, in blinded trials, sponsor staff or designated third parties
who are involved in operation of the trial and directly or indirectly interact with site
investigator staff should not have access to unblinding information.

4.1.3

The potential for unblinding should be part of the risk assessment of a blinded trial.
Any planned or unplanned unblinding, including accidental or emergency unblinding,
should be documented and assessed for impact to trial results.

4.3

Finalisation of Data Sets Prior to Analysis
(a)

Data of sufficient quality for interim and final analysis are achieved by
implementing timely and reliable processes for data capture, verification,
validation, review and rectification of errors and omissions that have a
meaningful impact on the safety of trial participants and/or the reliability of
the trial results.

(b)

Activities undertaken to finalise the data sets prior to analysis should be
confirmed and documented in accordance with pre-specified procedures.
These activities may include reconciliation of entered data and data sets or
reconciliation of relevant databases, correction of data errors and omissions,
medical coding, compilation and addressing the impact of non-compliance
including protocol deviations.

(c)

Data extraction and determination of data analysis sets should take place in
accordance with the planned statistical analysis and should be documented.

Computerised Systems
As described in sections 2 and 3, the responsibilities of the sponsor, investigator and
the activities of other parties with respect to a computerised system used in clinical
trials should be clear and documented. In summary, the sponsor is responsible for
ensuring that for computerised systems which they put in place, the expectations for
computerised systems as described in this section are addressed in a risk proportionate
manner. The sponsor should review whether the systems used by the
investigator/institution (e.g., electronic health records and other record keeping
systems for source data collection) are fit for purpose in the context of the trial. In the
event that the investigator/institution deploys systems specifically for the purposes of

The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) is a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical data on the
investigational product(s)1 that are relevant to the study of the product(s) in human participants.
Its purpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information
to facilitate their understanding of the rationale for and their compliance with many key
features of the protocol, such as the dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration
and safety monitoring procedures.

Introduction

A.1.1

Development of the Investigator’s Brochure
Generally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up-to-date IB is developed.
In the case of an investigator-initiated trial, the sponsor-investigator should determine
whether a brochure is available from the product license/marketing authorisation
holder. If the investigational product is provided by the sponsor-investigator, then they
should provide the necessary information to the investigator site staff. Where
permitted by regulatory authorities, the current scientific information such as a basic
product information brochure (e.g., summary of product characteristics package
leaflet, or labelling) may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes
current, comprehensive and detailed information on all aspects of the investigational
product that might be of importance to the investigator. If an authorised medicinal
product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB specific to that
new use should be prepared unless there is a rationale for only one IB. The IB should
be reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in compliance with a sponsor’s
documented procedures. More frequent revision may be appropriate depending on the
stage of development and the generation of relevant new information. Relevant new
information may be so important that it needs to be communicated to the investigators
and possibly to the IRBs/IECs and/or regulatory authorities before it is included in a
revised IB.

A.1.2

Reference Safety Information and Risk-Benefit Assessment
The reference safety information (RSI) contained in the IB provides an important
reference point for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse
reactions (SUSARs) in the clinical trial. The IB also provides insight to support the
clinical management of the participants during the course of the clinical trial. The
information should be presented in a concise, simple, objective, balanced and nonpromotional form that enables a clinician or potential investigator to understand it and
make their own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the
proposed trial. For this reason, a medically qualified person should be involved in the
generation of an IB, but the contents of the IB should be approved by the disciplines
that generated the described data.

For the purpose of this guideline, the term “investigational products” should be considered synonymous with
drugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products.

A summary of information should be provided about the investigational
product’s/products’ (including metabolites, where appropriate) safety,
pharmacodynamics, efficacy and dose response that was obtained from preceding
trials in humans (healthy volunteers and/or patients). The implications of this
information should be discussed. In cases where a number of clinical trials have been
completed, the use of summaries of safety and efficacy across multiple trials by
indications in subgroups may provide a clear presentation of the data. Tabular
summaries of adverse drug reactions for all the clinical trials (including those for all
the studied indications) would be useful. Important differences in adverse drug
reaction patterns/incidences across indications or subgroups should be discussed.

The IB should provide a description of the possible risks and adverse drug reactions
to be anticipated on the basis of prior experiences with the product under investigation
and with related products. There should be a list of adverse reactions, clearly identified
as the reference safety information section, including information on their frequency
and nature. This list should be used for determining the expectedness of a suspected
serious adverse reaction and subsequently whether it needs to be expedited in
accordance with regulatory requirements. A description should also be provided of
the precautions or special monitoring to be done as part of the investigational use of
the product(s).

or approved. Any significant information arising from the marketed use should be
summarised (e.g., formulations, dosages, routes of administration, adverse drug
reactions). The IB should also identify all the countries where the investigational
product did not receive approval/registration for marketing or was withdrawn from
marketing/registration.

Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator

2527
2528
2529
2530
2531

This section should provide an overall discussion of the nonclinical and clinical data
and should summarise the information from various sources on different aspects of
the investigational product(s), wherever possible. In this way, the investigator can be
provided with the most informative interpretation of the available data and with an
assessment of the implications of the information for future clinical trials.

2532
2533
2534

Where appropriate, the published reports on related products should be discussed.
This could help the investigator to anticipate adverse drug reactions or other problems
in clinical trials.

2535
2536
2537

The overall aim of this section is to provide the investigator with a clear understanding of the
possible risks and adverse reactions and of the specific tests, observations and precautions that
may be needed for a clinical trial. This understanding should be based on the available physical,
62

ICH E6(R3) Guideline
2538
2539
2540
2541

chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological and clinical information on the
investigational product(s). Guidance should also be provided to the clinical investigator on the
recognition and treatment of possible overdose and adverse drug reactions that is based on
previous human experience and on the pharmacology of the investigational product.

Clinical trials should be described in a clear, concise and operationally feasible protocol. The
protocol should be designed in such a way as to minimise unnecessary complexity and to
mitigate or eliminate important risks to the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial participants
and the reliability of data. Protocol development processes should incorporate input from
relevant stakeholders, where appropriate. Building adaptability into the protocol, for example,
by including acceptable ranges for specific protocol provisions, can reduce the number of
deviations or in some instances the requirement for a protocol amendment. Such adaptability
should not adversely affect participant safety or the scientific validity of the trial. For additional
information, refer to ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies and ICH E9
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials.

C.1.1

Many records are generated before and during the conduct of a clinical trial. The
nature and extent of those records generated and maintained are dependent upon the
trial design, its conduct, application of proportional approaches and the importance
and relevance of that record to the trial.

C.1.2

Determining which records are essential will be based upon consideration of the
guidance in this appendix.

C.1.3

The essential records permit and contribute to the evaluation of the conduct of a trial
and the reliability of the results produced. They serve to demonstrate the compliance
of the investigator and sponsor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
and applicable regulatory requirements. The essential records are used as part of the
sponsor oversight or investigator supervision of the trial. These records are used by
the sponsor’s independent audit function and during inspections by regulatory
authority(ies) to assess the trial conduct and the reliability of the trial results. The
investigator/institution should have access to and the ability to maintain and retain the
essential records generated by the investigator/institution before, during and after the
trial.

2726

C.2.1

Records should be identifiable and version controlled, and should include authors,
reviewers and approvers as appropriate, along with date and signature (electronic or
wet ink), where necessary.

C.2.2

For activities that are transferred or delegated to service providers by the sponsor or
investigator/institution respectively, arrangements should be made for the access and
management of the essential records throughout the trial and for their retention
following completion of the trial.

C.2.3

These essential records should be maintained in or referred to from repositories,
including, for example, the trial master file (TMF) or investigator site file (ISF). The
TMF is held by the sponsor or by the investigator; in the latter case, it is often called
the ISF.

C.2.4

The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of where essential
records are located, including source records. The storage system(s) used during the
trial and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for
appropriate identification, version history, search and retrieval of trial records.

C.2.5

The sponsor and investigator/institution should ensure that the essential records are
collected and filed in a timely manner, including those required to be in place prior to
the trial start, which can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial.

C.2.6

The sponsor and investigator/institution should retain the essential records in a way
that ensures that they remain complete, readable and readily available and are directly
accessible upon request by regulatory authorities. Alteration to the essential records
should be traceable.

C.2.7

The original version of the essential record should be retained by the responsible party
(sponsor or investigator). When a copy is used to permanently replace the original
essential record, the copy should fulfil the requirements for certified copies.

C.2.8

In order to fulfil their responsibilities in the conduct of the trial, the sponsor and
investigator/institution may need access to or copies of one another’s relevant
essential records before, during and after the trial is completed. This will determine
whether the record resides in the repositories of the sponsor, the
investigator/institution, or both. There should be careful consideration of sharing of
records subject to data protection legislation and blinding considerations in line with
applicable regulatory requirements. For the sharing of essential records with service
providers, see section C.2.2.

C.2.9

Certain essential records may not be specific to a trial but may be related to the
systems and processes involved in running multiple trials and retained outside the
trial-specific repositories (e.g., standard operating procedures validation records,
master services agreements).

2749

C.3
